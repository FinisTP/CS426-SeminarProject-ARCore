# CS426-SeminarProject-ARCore
This project aims to use ARCore technologies with Sceneform API to create a modern AR game. We first borrow the interior design template from mfaisal881996 (github.com/mfaisal881996/SimpleARInteriorDesign) and extend upon it with the ability to spawn enemy objects and shoot them down in augmented reality space. We intend to expand further by implementing the Depth Detection API and allow entities to change their anchors appropriately around the camera scene.

The work is solely established for educational purposes and not for commercial publishing. This project is accredited to the course CS426 - Mobile Application Development, offerred to the following students in HCMUS - APCS program:
